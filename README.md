Oh, the Places You'll Email!

Quick and dirty chrome extension that makes looking for rentals with craigslist and gmail slightly less painful.

It adds to the right sidebar of gmail the image from the post (linking back to the original craigslist post) and a map showing its location (linking to google maps). It modifies the mailto link on craigslist posts to include a message template, which can be configured in the extension settings.
